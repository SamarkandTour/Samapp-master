## Introduction

Welcome to the "Samapp" project!

The Samapp is the "Samarkand offline Map based Mobile APPlication" for tourist.

This is the cooperation project of universities in Samarkand of which the center is a UNESCO world Heritage Site. We're targeting to provide unknown, hidden and unique all tour information for your visit.

For your great experience in this city, we're also providing Android Mobile Application for Smart Tour Guide Service by the help of ICT. At the App, we suggest recommended itineraries by careful screening. Of course, if you want, you can customize your own day-by-day itinerary based on our recommendation. Furthermore, since it's designed for offline usage, you can utilize all information on your way without any data connection. It also has a navigation function by GSP so that it safely guide you to the destination without losing your way.

We always welcome all kinds of your contribution and cooperation. You can make this project abundant by adding new data or modifying legacy data directly at our Wiki and by leaving your helpful comment for others after visiting tour places.
